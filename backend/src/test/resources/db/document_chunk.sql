Resumo: A ética aristotélica. O objetivo deste artigo é mostrar que o estudo da ética
de Aristóteles é fundamental ao estudo da ética ocidental. A ética de Aristóteles é
uma ética do bom senso, fundada nos juízos morais do homem bom e virtuoso. Neste
sentido, mostraremos que a ética de Aristóteles se articula a partir de uma pergunta
fundamental: qual é o bem supremo do homem e o fim a que tendem todas as coisas?
Evidenciaremos, então, que o bem supremo do homem é a felicidade. É a atividade da
alma conforme a razão e a virtude. É a atividade contemplativa do intelecto. Por fim,
mostraremos brevemente que a verdadeira felicidade do homem bom e virtuoso está
na síntese entre a vida contemplativa e a vida ativa.
Palavras-chaves: Aristóteles, Ética, Virtude, Contemplação, Felicidade

Summary: The aristotelian ethics. The aim of this article is intended to show that the
study of the ethics in Aristotle is fundamental to the study of the occidental ethics.
The ethics in Aristotle is an ethics of good sense, groundede in the moral judgements
of good end virtuous man. In this sense, we will show that the ethics of Aristotle is
compound from a fundamental question: What is the supreme good of man and the
end to wich all things tend? We will make evidente thus that the supreme good of
man is happiness. It is agency of the soul, in accordance with reason and virtue. It is
the contemplative agency of the intellect. Finally, we will show briefly that the real
happiness of a good and virtuous man rests in the synthesis between the contemplative
life and the active life.
Key words: Aristotle, ethics, virtue, contemplation,');

 Discordando de Platão, para Aristóteles, o primado é da práxis e não da teoria. O
pensamento deve contribuir para a própria atividade da vida humana. Aqui o pen-

existir e o ser éticos supõem a vida na pólis. É a condição da vida racional. Assim,
o engajamento político é pressuposição de teoria política. Para Aristóteles, ética
neutra é contra-senso. Pretendê-la significa desconhecer a estrutura específica da
ciência');

'dição da vida racional. Assim,
o engajamento político é pressuposição de teoria política. Para Aristóteles, ética
neutra é contra-senso. Pretendê-la significa desconhecer a estrutura específica da
ciência em questão. A reflexão ética é o ato através do qual o homem rompe o caráter
opressor de todo “ethos” e transforma sua vida, até então realizada ingenuamente no
seio de determinado “ethos”, numa vida racional, produzida pela razão consciente de
si. Da reflexão ética não resulta necessariamente a destruição do “ethos” vigente,
mas, antes, a legitimação racional da ação humana, ou seja, a compreensão das
razões que justificam tal modo de agir. Trata-se, em Aristóteles, da unidade originá-
ria entre um fato e uma exigência moral, isto é, uma síntese entre o incondicionado
e o condicionado. Ver a respeito, MANFREDO ARAÚJO DE OLIVERIA, op. cit., pp. 55-77.

trumental-mecanicista” do pensamento aristotélico . Esta fase começa,
em 347, quando Aristóteles deixa Atenas, após a morte de Platão, e vai,
provavelmente, até 335/334, quando Aristóteles rompe com certos as-
pectos da doutrina platônica. Nesta fase, Aristóteles renunciara a dou-
trina das idéias e rejeita o pessimismo platônico. A concepção aristotélica
do homem, neste período de transição, situa a alma hierarquicamente
acima do corpo, mas sem dar-lhe qualquer transcendência. O corpo é
um instrumento da alma e deve colaborar com ela na realização da sua
tarefa enquanto homem. A alma comanda e o corpo obedece. O corpo
5
é subordinado como instrumento da alma . O corpo é, total e exclusi-
6
vamente, feito para o bem da alma
Outro ponto importante a elucidar é o método aristotélico subjacente à
7
Ética a Nicômacos. Aristóteles não aceita o método matemático de Platão');

filosofia teórica. Ver a respeito, ROBERT SPAEMANN, Felicidade e benevolência: ensaio
sobre ética, São Paulo, Loyola, 1996, p. 27.

Aristóteles procurou fundar sua

II. O bem supremo do homem: a
felicidade
Esclarecidos esses aspectos preliminares, podemos, agora, iniciar, pro-
priamente, a discussão do problema do bem supremo em Aristóteles.
Logo no início da Ética a Nicômacos, Aristóteles dá o tom geral de toda
sua ética. Toda arte e toda investigação e igualmente toda ação e toda
10
escolha tendem a algum bem . Toda ação visa alguma coisa e de sua
tendência a produzir esta coisa ela tira seu valor. A ética aristotélica é
nitidamente teleológica. Aristóteles interpreta a ação humana segundo
a categoria de meio e fim. O fim ao qual tende uma ação particular não
pode ser senão um meio em vista de um fim ulterior, mas é necessário
que tenha um limite para a seqüência. Cada ação deve ter um fim
último que tenha um valor nele mesmo, e, conclui Aristóteles, sem
11
hesitação, o fim último de todas as coisas deve ser o mesmo .

'Cada ação deve ter um fim

hesitação, o fim último de todas as coisas deve ser o mesmo .
Após notar uma diferença quanto aos fins, uns na atividade, outros da
12
obra , Aristóteles aborda a hierarquia dos bens, descobrindo que o bem
sentam a sabedoria coletiva da raça; deve partir disso, para atingir os primeiros
princípios; — examinar as crenças, compará-las, entre si, purificando-as de suas
inexatidões e incoerências, para resgatar as virtudes. A ética, portanto, não é de-
monstrativa. Aristóteles raciocina dialeticamente, partindo não dos primeiros prin-
cípios, mas das opiniões do grande número de homens. Ver a respeito, W. D. ROSS,
Aristote, Paris, Payot, 1930, p. 265.

 A partir da divisão da ciência, pode-se dizer que a atividade nas ciências práticas
(ética e política) constitui-se na práxis, enquanto, nas ciências poiéticas, na poíesis
= no trabalho. O que caracteriza a práxis como ação imanente é a “enérgeia”, isto é,
o ato, a perfeição. Enquanto que a poíesis é a “kinesis”, ou seja, a atividade vai do
sujeito ao objeto. A primeira é uma ação do sujeito para o sujeito = é auto-realização.
A segunda é uma ação do sujeito para o objeto = é uma hétero-realização. Enquanto
a primeira busca a virtude, a segunda busca a habilidade. Na práxis, a própria
atividade se constitui no próprio fim; a atividade tem intrínseca seu próprio fim. Já,
nas ciências técnicas, a atividade não tem o fim em si mesma. Ver a respeito, Henrique
Claúdio de Lima Vaz, Escritos de Filosofia II: Ética e cultura, São Paulo, Loyola,
1993, pp. 80-134. Ainda neste sentido, a obra de arte requer tempo, força, concentra-
ção e esforço, sem que tais fatores');

um bem realizável e atuável pelo homem e para o homem. A noção
aristotélica do bem é, então, uma noção analógica e não unívoca como
13
a idéia separada do bem por Platão , e a ética é a ciência do bem do
indivíduo, como a política é a ciência do bem na sociedade política.
Há uma variedade de ações e, conseqüentemente, uma variedade de
14
bens . Mas há um bem soberano que não depende de nada. Depende
somente de si mesmo e em vista dele desejamos todos os demais.
Este bem deve ser final, isto é, escolhido por ele mesmo e não como
um meio para atingir outra coisa qualquer. Deve ser suficiente por
ele mesmo, isto é, tornar, por ele mesmo, a vida digna de ser esco-
lhida. É auto-suficiente e pode ser definido como aquilo que, em si,
torna a vida desejável por não ser carente de coisa alguma. É, por-
15
tanto, algo final e auto-suficiente, e é o fim a que visam as ações .

de todas as nossas atividades e de qual ciência');

Aristóteles quer saber, então, qual é o bem supremo, absoluto e o fim
de todas as nossas atividades e de qual ciência ele é objeto. Segundo
Aristóteles, é aquilo a que todas as coisas aspiram e buscam. Este fim
supremo ou soberano bem não é mais um meio em vista de um fim
ulterior, mas é algo buscado por ele mesmo, em vista do qual todos
os outros fins particulares são buscados e subordinados hierarquica-
mente. Sem este fim último, absoluto a faculdade do desejar seria
vazia e vã. Portanto, o soberano bem é a condição para que os outros
sejam bens. Com essa compreensão, não podemos fazer da riqueza e
16
do prazer o fim da vida, tornar-nos-íamos semelhantes a bestas e
não exerceríamos a atividade específica de homens. Aristóteles acre-
13
 Platão havia proposto uma espécie de bem abstrato, uma forma de bem que seria
a fonte de toda bondade. Aristóteles objeta: — porque o termo bem não tem signi-
ficação');

 Platão havia proposto uma espécie de bem abstrato, uma forma de bem que seria
a fonte de toda bondade. Aristóteles objeta: — porque o termo bem não tem signi-
ficação comum a todas as aplicações; — porque ele não é uma forma de bem inde-
pendente das manifestações particulares; — porque se ele tivesse uma forma de bem
separado, ela não serviria para nada na prática. O bem para o homem é o bem maior
no qual a contemplação deve ajudar-nos em nossa vida diária. Ver a respeito W. D.
ROSS, op. cit., p. 267. Ver também, GIOVANNI REALE, op. cit., p. 408.

 Ética a Nicômacos, I, 7. A respeito de ser algo final e imprescindível, deve-se ter
presente que Aristóteles, na sua doutrina, aproxima princípio e télos. Tudo aquilo
que está para o “devir” caminha para o princípio e sua finalidade. Então, segundo a
ordem do “devir”, a felicidade é o télos, mas, na ordem da essência, a felicidade é o
princípio. Ver Aristóteles, Met., 1049');

 Segundo Aristóteles, há três tipos principais de vida: a vida do prazer, a vida

cidade, nós trataremos no ponto VI: o prazer e a felicidade, conforme p. 19. Ver
adiante a este respeito também nota “81”.

dita que a felicidade é este bem soberano, porque é algo final e auto-
suficiente. Acerca de qual ciência é objeto, aparentemente, ele é ob-
jeto da ciência mais imperativa e predominante sobre tudo. Parece
que ela é a política, pois ela determina quais são as demais ciências
que devem ser estudadas em uma cidade e legisla sobre o que deve-
mos fazer e sobre aquilo de que devemos abster-nos. Desse modo, a
finalidade desta ciência inclui a finalidade das outras e esta finalida-

e “por causa de si” sem jamais ser subordinado a um outro bem. Ora,
como já dissemos, um só bem responde a tal exigência. É a felicidade.
Deste modo, os prazeres, a potencialidade política, a contemplação,
que são fins últimos para cada um dos gêneros de vida em questão
preeminente, são, na verdade, fins relativos à felicidade. Esta é um
verdadeiro fim com toda a excelência e o único fim verdadeiramente');

'egundo Aristóteles, não é obviamente a forma extrínseca ou a figura
exterior das coisas, mas é a natureza interior das coisas. É a essência íntima das
mesmas. A forma, ou essência do homem, por exemplo, é a sua alma, ou seja, o que
faz dele um ser vivo racional. A forma ou essência do animal é a alma sensitiva e a
da planta, a alma vegetativa. Ou ainda, a essência do círculo é o que faz com que ele
seja aquela figura com aquelas determinadas qualidades; e o mesmo pode-se dizer
das outras coisas. Quando definimos as coisas, referimo-nos à sua forma ou essência
e, em geral, as coisas só são conhecíveis na sua essência. Ver a respeito das
especificações sobre os significados do ser GIOVANNI REALE, op. cit., pp. 347-362. Ainda
a esse respeito, diz-nos Aristóteles: o fim final e último é o princípio do movimento,
é sua causa e por causa dele fazemos tudo o resto. Tudo o que é bom por si e por
sua própria natureza é um fim e uma causa no sentido de que as coisas tornam-se
e existem em vista disto.');

'iz, o homem deve viver pela inteligên-
27
cia e segundo a inteligência .
Aristóteles afirma que a atividade própria do homem é um certo
modo de vida, e este é constituído de uma atividade ou de ações da
alma que pressupõem o uso da razão. A atividade própria de um
homem bom é o bom e o nobilitante exercício da atividade da razão.
Assim, se o bem para o homem vem a ser o exercício ativo das
faculdades da alma de conformidade com a excelência e se há mais
de uma excelência, então, o bem deve estar em conformidade com a
melhor e a mais completa entre elas. Mas deve-se acrescentar que tal
exercício ativo deve estender-se por toda a vida, porque uma ando-
rinha não faz verão e um dia só não faz verão, assim como um curto
28
lapso de tempo não faz um homem bem-aventurado e feliz .
b) A felicidade é a atividade da alma conforme a virtude
A atividade do homem não é uma atividade da alma vegetativa ou
sensitiva ou ainda uma atividade ligada ao corpo. É exclusivamente
a atividade da parte racional');

alma humana encontra na prática das virtudes, na atividade de

obstáculo para a alma, estabelecendo assim uma relação de interesse
e de proveito entre os dois, em benefício da alma que está hierar-

obedecer quando o seu desejo torna-se impermeável à razão, mas
pode sujeitar-se à parte racional por meio de uma participação do

desejo na racionalidade, deixando-se impregnar por ela . A alma é

'corpo e na alma a parte melhor é a parte regrada pelo

princípio de ação e um contemplador da verdade. Toda moral de
Aristóteles consiste em viver a vida de um outro e não a vida do

corpo. É absurdo viver a vida de um outro e não a vida do espírito :
“é porque nós somos o nosso espírito, e porque o corpo é para nós
um outro, que toda a moral consiste em viver a vida do espírito e não

A partir das partes da alma, Aristóteles faz a dedução das virtudes.
Divide, portanto, as virtudes em duas classes, as quais correspondem
às partes da alma. As virtudes éticas correspondem à parte irracional
e as virtudes dianoéticas, à parte racional. Então, a parte da alma
especificamente humana, que consiste em dominar as tendências e
impulsos, que são por si desmedidos, a esta Aristóteles chama de
virtude ética. Visto que existe em nós uma alma puramente racional,
deverá, por conseguinte, existir uma virtude peculiar dessa parte da
alma e esta será a virtude dianoética.
a) As virtudes éticas
As virtudes éticas são numerosas e bem numerosos são os impulsos
e os sentimentos que a razão deve moderar. As virtudes éticas deri-
vam e são produto em nós do hábito. Nascem, desenvolvem-se e

aperfeiçoam-se pela prática . Não são naturais. Mas também não
podem ir contra a natureza do ser. Pela natureza, somos potencial-
mente capazes de formar os hábitos e, mediante o exercício, traduzi-
mos essa potencialidade em atualidade. As virtudes são adquiridas
de uma atividade prévia. O constante exercício vai nos dar a facul-

é produzida por uma atividade. A atividade, portanto, precede a
potencialidade. Para Aristóteles, as virtudes éticas são aprendidas à
semelhança do aprendizado das diferentes artes, que também são
hábitos. Assim, construindo casas, tornamo-nos arquitetos, tocando

moderados e praticando as ações corajosas que nos tornamos corajosos (cf. Ética a

'tudes, São Paulo, Martins Fontes, 1996, p. 17. A virtude
moral não é uma paixão; paixão é um movimento passageiro. Não é uma simples
potencialidade, pois toda a potencialidade é inata. A virtude moral é algo que depen-

lei e forma na razão. A virtude moral é uma conquista da liberdade que consiste
numa subordinação duradoura de nossos apetites irracionais ao ditame da razão. Ver
a respeito CLODIUS PIAT, Aristote, Paris, 1903, p. 303.

moral, isto é, aquela mesma que o homem sábio daria . Definir a
natureza comum de todas as virtudes éticas é primordial, pois dizer
apenas como adquirimos e como possuímos essas virtudes não nos
diz ainda');

Definir a
natureza comum de todas as virtudes éticas é primordial, pois dizer
apenas como adquirimos e como possuímos essas virtudes não nos
diz ainda em que consistem as virtudes. Para Aristóteles, nunca há
virtude, quando há excesso ou falta, ou seja, quando há demais ou de
menos. Virtude implica a justa proporção, que é a via de meio entre
dois excessos. A virtude ética é, precisamente, mediania entre dois
vícios, dos quais um é por falta e o outro é por excesso. A virtude
pertence ao campo do determinado e do limitado, enquanto o exces-
so ou a falta (vícios) pertencem ao indeterminado ou ao ilimitado,
algo repugnável para os gregos.

'é uma privação do prazer e con-
corre à diminuição de nossas energias —, o outro é por excesso —
todo excesso da ação produz um excesso de prazer a ponto de obs-
45
curecer as luzes da razão e tende a degenerar-se em dor . Neste
momento, é importante perceber, na doutrina de Aristóteles, que a
mediania não é mediocridade, mas sua antítese. O justo meio, de
fato, está acima dos extremos, representando a sua superação e,
portanto, um cume, isto é, o ponto mais elevado do ponto de vista
46
do valor, enquanto assinala a afirmação da razão sobre o irracional .
Por isso, a virtude, segundo a sua essência e segundo a razão que
estabelece a sua natureza, é uma mediania, mas com relação ao bem
47
e à perfeição, ela é o ponto mais elevado . Acompanhando este ra-
ciocínio, diz-nos Aristóteles, não há meio termo no excesso ou na
falta, porque já são vícios, já não estão de acordo com a natureza
humana. Não há meio termo de excesso e falta, nem excesso e defi-
48
ciência de meio termo .

potencialidade precede o ato, nas virtudes, a potencialidade é
resultado da ação. Pode-se, no entanto, dizer que o homem foi
dotado, por natureza, de certas capacidades e faculdades de ação.
A natureza nos tem feito capazes de virtude. Mas para que estas
capacidades e faculdades ajam perfeitamente, é preciso que o
homem adquira qualidades que disponham estas faculdades ao
bem agir. Vê-se, assim, que as virtudes, fruto do exercício e do
hábito, devem ser esclarecidas pelo conhecimento, para dar lugar
às escolhas refletidas das ações morais. Portanto, se, por um lado,
Aristóteles sublinha a aquisição das virtudes pelo exercício e pelo
hábito, por outro, não ignora o aspecto do conhecimento da ciên-
cia moral, ou seja, a virtude supõe uma eleição reflexiva, uma
intenção voluntária, uma inteligência. As virtudes éticas têm na
razão seu valor. Elas têm por ofício tornar participante da razão
a parte irracional do homem. Então,');

o primeiro é pensamento impregnado de desejo, que fixa os meios
para obter o fim, enquanto o segundo é o pensamento puro cujo
51
fim é a contemplação . Aristóteles, à luz dessa diferença, diz que a
típica virtude da razão prática é a prudência, sabedoria prática,
(phrónesis), enquanto a típica virtude da razão teorética é a sabedo-
52
ria, sabedoria teórica, (sophia) . Segundo Aristóteles, em grande par-
te, as virtudes dianoéticas ou intelectuais devem tanto o seu nasci-
mento quanto o seu crescimento à instrução e têm, por sua vez, a
53
percepção da verdade como função .
O conceito de prudência (phrónesis) é um dos conceitos mais origi-
nais da moral aristotélica. A prudência, virtude do intelecto prático,
é uma virtude intelectual do tipo original e o conhecimento que lhe
é próprio é um conhecimento específico. Consiste');

nais da moral aristotélica. A prudência, virtude do intelecto prático,
é uma virtude intelectual do tipo original e o conhecimento que lhe
é próprio é um conhecimento específico. Consiste em saber dirigir
corretamente a vida do homem. Como virtude, ela é também um
estado habitual em vista de uma tarefa que, neste caso, não consiste
54
no justo meio mas em dizer a verdade . Não a verdade pura, mas
a verdade da ação a ser feita. Portanto, a virtude intelectual prática
é um estado habitual verdadeiro que dirige a ação. Ora, se o
intelecto prático é impregnado de desejo e se sua atividade não é
mais a pura verdade, então, nele, a verdade é a duração da retidão
do desejo. Isso que caracteriza o intelecto prático é o fim a que ele
se propõe, ou seja, dirigir a ação. Em outras palavras, o intelecto
prático tem a função de perceber e dizer a verdade concernente ao

 Antes de mais nada, é bom salientar que prudência, sabedoria prática, e sabedoria,
teórica teórica, não se contrapõem.');

 Antes de mais nada, é bom salientar que prudência, sabedoria prática, e sabedoria,
teórica teórica, não se contrapõem. Apresentar a prudência em oposição à sabedoria,
dizendo que esta é especulativa, que reina, mas não governa imediatamente a ação
humana — espécie de sabedoria prática oposta à sabedoria — seria não entender e
não caracterizar verdadeiramente o pensamento de Aristóteles. A sabedoria não é
estranha à ação que ela dirige, assim como a prudência não pode ser qualificada
somente como disposição prática, porque, então, distinguir-se-ía mal da virtude ética,
justamente quando Aristóteles insiste sempre sobre o estatuto da virtude dianoética.

'ndo prudência e virtude
se reencontram. O reencontro do pensamento e do desejo dá-se, com
efeito, na decisão. Porque a prudência é o princípio da decisão e a
decisão é o princípio da ação. A virtude intelectual é um estado
habitual verdadeiro que dirige a ação. Eis, então, a razão pela qual
a prudência vai sempre junto com a virtude ética: ela dirige a decisão
afirmando a verdade enquanto a virtude deseja o justo meio. Assim,
a prudência (sabedoria prática) não é apenas uma regulação das nossas
ações, mas ela exprime uma obrigação propriamente dita. A prudên-
cia não julga, ela decide. Não conhece simplesmente, ela faz. Ela é,
57
portanto, o princípio da decisão .
Posto que o justo meio, no qual consiste a virtude ética, é determi-
nado pela prudência, virtude do intelecto prático, deve-se reconhecer
que a virtude ética está subordinada à virtude intelectual. Porém,
como já dissemos, a virtude intelectual não se reduz à prudência. Há
também a virtude do intelecto teórico, enquanto pura');

de perfeita. A virtude suprema e o princípio da felicidade é um

estado estritamente intelectual . Pois é uma atividade perfeita, auto-
suficiente, tendo em si o próprio fim, enquanto tende a conhecer por
ela mesma os objetos com os quais o intelecto se relaciona, os quais
são os melhores. Na atividade da contemplação intelectiva, o homem
alcança o vértice das suas possibilidades e atualiza o que há de mais
elevado nele. E somente esta atividade parece ser estimada por sua
própria causa, pois é auto-suficiente, ágil, ininterrupta quanto possí-
vel ao homem e parece que em tal atividade encontram-se todas as
61
qualidades atribuídas ao homem feliz .
Para Aristóteles, a sabedoria filosófica é reconhecidamente a mais
perfeita e a mais agradável das atividades conforme o intelecto
62
especulativo. A filosofia é a virtude do intelecto especulativo, habi-
litando-nos a dizer a verdade e tornando-nos capazes da atividade
da contemplação. Torna-nos capazes de contemplar o que há de mais');

'especulativo. A filosofia é a virtude do intelecto especulativo, habi-
litando-nos a dizer a verdade e tornando-nos capazes da atividade
da contemplação. Torna-nos capazes de contemplar o que há de mais
sublime e divino e é dessas belas e divinas realidades que a contem-
63
plação faz nossa felicidade . Aqui é importante perceber isto. A con-
templação de Deus não interessa tanto, para Aristóteles, quanto a
perfeição do homem. Preocupa-se muito mais com um bem que o
homem possa realizar. Este bem consiste, precisamente satisfazer sua
atividade própria de homem. Atividade que não é nada mais e nada
menos que a mais alta atividade do homem. É a atividade
contemplativa. A contemplação aristotélica, portanto, não saberá ser
apenas estritamente intelectual. Sua ambição é aperfeiçoar o sujeito,
que é intelecto, para que ele seja feliz, exercendo sua atividade pró-
pria de homem e não simplesmente exercendo a contemplação de um
64
objeto transcendental .

 A filosofia é a virtude do intelecto especulativo. Em outros termos, é o estado
habitual que habilita o intelecto especulativo a dizer a verdade. A filosofia é uma
ciência coroada de inteligência e é a ciência entre as mais sublimes. Segundo Gauthier,
Aristóteles estabelece três etapas para mostrar que a filosofia é a ciência coroada de
inteligência. a) Nos II Analíticos, Aristóteles diz que a ciência é um estado habitual
que dirige a demonstração e que nenhuma demonstração se basta a si mesma. Toda
a demonstração, ao contrário, pressupõe princípios que não são objetos de demons-
tração, mas de intuição. b) Se existe uma virtude do intelecto especulativo, ela não
pode, então, ser qualquer ciência, mas uma ciência perfeita, cujas demonstrações');

Aristóteles assinala como fim do homem a contemplação e esta é
essencialmente atividade do intelecto, o qual define o homem como
65
animal que participa do divino e é o que há de mais divino no
homem. Viver, portanto, segundo o que há de mais sublime em nós,
é uma exigência primordial intransferível a cada homem. O soberano
bem é exercer bem sua atividade própria de homem. Assim, a con-
templação de Deus leva-nos à perfeição e, conseqüentemente, à feli-
cidade. Porém, para levarmos uma vida sempre divina é impossível.
É uma vida demasiado elevada para o homem. Contudo, nada é mais
contínuo que a atividade da contemplação. Aristóteles sabe das difi-
culdades da vida contínua da contemplação à semelhança da vida
completa, ininterrupta e perfeita de Deus. Não obstante, insiste na
necessidade de vivê-la, pois é a mais sublime e comporta a nossa
66
natureza humana, a qual faz-nos participar da vida divina .

V. A amizade e a felicidade
Aristóteles dedica dois livros da Ética a Nicômacos ao tema da ami-
zade. Ela é uma forma de virtude moral ou é concomitante com a
virtude moral, além de ser extremamente necessária na vida. De
todos os bens que concorrem à felicidade, a amizade, após a sabedo-
ria e a virtude, é o mais estimável e mais indispensável ao homem.
De fato, ninguém deseja viver sem amigos, mesmo dispondo de to-
67
dos os outros bens . A amizade ajuda as pessoas a pensar, agir,
manter-se unidas, e praticar a justiça, pois considera-se que a mais
autêntica forma de justiça é uma disposição amistosa. Assim, a ami-
zade não é apenas necessária, ela é também uma das coisas mais
68
nobilitantes .
Não há, porém, apenas uma espécie de amizade. Para entendê-las, é
necessário conhecermos o objeto do amor. Parece');

'dade e o amor ao
bem. A amizade é como um prolongamento inevitável da virtude. Ela
completa a virtude e, conseqüentemente, é essencial à verdadeira feli-
cidade. Com efeito, a amizade virtuosa é, em cada um dos amigos, uma
73
bem-aventurança afetuosa que quer ao outro seu verdadeiro bem . Os
amigos têm prazer ao colocar em comum o que cada um tem de me-
lhor, pois nós amamos o amigo como um outro de nós mesmo.
“A amizade perfeita é a existente entre as pessoas boas e semelhantes em
termos de excelência moral; neste caso, cada uma das pessoas quer bem à
outra de maneira idêntica, porque a outra pessoa é boa, e elas são boas em
si mesmas. Então as pessoas que querem bem aos seus amigos por causa
deles são amigas no sentido mais amplo, pois querem bem por causa da
própria natureza dos amigos, e não por acidente; logo, sua amizade durará
74
enquanto estas pessoas forem boas, e ser bom é uma coisa duradoura” .
A verdadeira amizade, afirma Aristóteles, nasce do sentido de ami-
zade para consigo');

Imprescindível, aqui, dar-nos conta disto. Há duas partes existen-
tes em nós: a parte relativa às riquezas e aos prazeres é a parte
inferior, e a parte própria do homem, a parte superior, é a parte
racional com seus bens e atividade específica. Ora, cabe ao ho-
mem amar a parte superior e desejar o mesmo aos seus amigos.
Pois, a amizade, para Aristóteles, é o desabrochamento da virtu-
de; é desabrochamento normal de uma atividade humana plena
de vida, de força, de inteligência, de alegria. Com efeito, a ami-
zade virtuosa não nasce de uma hora para outra, de um dia para
o outro ou do acaso, exige a atividade da virtude, da autenticida-
de e, conseqüentemente, a necessidade do tempo. Por isso, nas
verdadeiras amizades, o útil e o agradável se encontram — mas
sempre subordinados ao bem da virtude, ou seja, da felicidade —
e, assim, as mesmas têm a solidez mesma da virtude e são as mais');

Quanto ao número de amigos, diz-nos Aristóteles. Assim como não
se pode fazer uma cidade com dez pessoas e se houver cem mil
pessoas não se tem mais uma simples cidade, também quanto aos
amigos, deve-se ter o número conveniente. É óbvio que uma pessoa
não pode conviver com muitas outras nem dividir-se entre elas. Pensa-
se também que é difícil a uma pessoa participar intimamente das
alegrias e tristezas de muitas pessoas. Presume-se, então, que é bom
não procurar ter tantos amigos quantos pudermos, mas tantos quantos
bastarem para efeito de convivência, pois parece realmente impossí-
vel ser um grande amigo de muitas pessoas. A amizade verdadeira
77
somente pode ser sentida em relação a poucas pessoas . Porque o
amigo verdadeiro é agradável, conforta-nos');

somente pode ser sentida em relação a poucas pessoas . Porque o
amigo verdadeiro é agradável, conforta-nos tanto com sua presença
como com suas palavras, é perspicaz, pois nos conhece. A satisfação
do amigo é a convivência. Com efeito, a amizade é uma parceria e
uma pessoa está em relação a si própria da mesma forma que em
relação ao seu amigo. Então, a consciência de sua existência é um
bem e a consciência da existência do seu amigo também o é. É natu-

VI. O prazer e a felicidade
A relação entre prazer e felicidade, em Aristóteles, é imprescindível,
porque, sem um estudo aprofundado do prazer, corre-se o risco de
considerar a moral aristotélica unicamente um “hedonismo intelectual”
ou, então, pensar que a atividade virtuosa não é querida senão em vista
do prazer que ela procura. O estudo do prazer revelar-nos-á mais cla-
79
ramente isto que é a atividade prazerosa do homem .
Aristóteles liga a felicidade à atividade virtuosa. Visto que o homem
não consegue viver sem uma certa dose de alegria e deleite, o prazer
é uma recompensa natural da vida virtuosa. O prazer torna as ativida-
des perfeitas e torna, portanto, a vida perfeita e isto é o que as pessoas
80
desejam . Contrapondo-se a Êudoxos e também a Platão, Aristóteles
diz, respectivamente, que o prazer é algo desejável e um dos bens, não
é a satisfação das carências, como também não é o');

desejam . Contrapondo-se a Êudoxos e também a Platão, Aristóteles
diz, respectivamente, que o prazer é algo desejável e um dos bens, não
é a satisfação das carências, como também não é o resultado de um
81
movimento ou de um processo de geração . Para Aristóteles, o prazer
aperfeiçoa a atividade própria do homem. Agir pelo prazer, conforme
a concepção aristotélica, é uma necessidade, porque a regra do prazer
é precisamente favorecer a atividade pelo incentivo desta finalidade, ou
seja, ordenar todo ser a imitar a atividade divina, buscando participar
do prazer eterno de Deus. O prazer não é ele mesmo o fim da ativida-
82
de, mas ele é para a atividade perfeita um suplemento de finalidade .
O prazer, como o ato de ver, parece perfeito. O ato de ver parece
perfeito a qualquer momento, pois ele não necessita de qualquer coisa
superveniente que torne perfeita a sua forma. Parece que esta também
é a natureza do prazer, pois ele é um todo, e em tempo algum se pode
83
achar um prazer');

 Êudoxos pensa que o prazer é o bem soberano, o bem mais desejado (Ética a
Nicômacos, X, 2, 1172 b). Para Platão, por sua vez, o prazer é indefinido, porque
admite uma graduação (Filebo, 24 e — 25 a, 31 a); apresenta o prazer como sendo
um movimento e um processo de geração(Filebo, 53 c — 54 d); e sendo o sofrimento
a carência daquilo que é conforme a natureza, o prazer é a satisfação desta carência
(Filebo, 31 e — 32 b, 42 c -d). Para Aristóteles, o prazer é um todo, é como uma
perfeição cumulativa e não é um processo. É uma “enérgeia”. O movimento cessa
quando chega ao seu termo, enquanto a “enérgeia”, ao contrário, dura em sua per-
feição, em seu acabamento.');

'r é um todo, é como uma
perfeição cumulativa e não é um processo. É uma “enérgeia”. O movimento cessa
quando chega ao seu termo, enquanto a “enérgeia”, ao contrário, dura em sua per-
feição, em seu acabamento. O movimento tende a um resultado exterior a ele mesmo
(Met., 1048 b 30-34). A “enérgeia”, ao contrário, tem seu fim nela mesma, em seu
próprio exercício. A visão e a atividade contemplativa são exemplos da “enérgeia”
(Ética a Nicômacos, X, 4, 1174 a). O prazer, segundo Aristóteles, é da mesma natu-
reza da “enérgeia”. Ele está em vista da realização, mas plenamente realizado e
perfeito a cada instante de sua duração e sua prolongação não acrescenta nada à sua
essência puramente espiritual. Ver a respeito JOSEPH MOREAU, op. cit., p. 221.

'a da perfeição das atividades do homem. Assim, o prazer é
como que o coroamento de toda atividade, a qual deve visar sempre
o fim último do homem, a contemplação. Porque a questão crucial do
prazer, para Aristóteles, não está em agir pelo prazer, mas na lei
teleológica que ordena ao homem tender a imitar sempre a atividade
de Deus que é puro prazer. Deve-se buscar participar pela contem-
plação no prazer eterno de Deus. Ora, quanto mais a atividade tende
à sua realização perfeita, mais a atividade é agradável. Logo, o grau de
85
felicidade é medido pelo grau de contemplação , pois tanto quanto se
86
estende a contemplação, igualmente se estende a felicidade .

parte desiderante do homem. O homem virtuoso está presente como

mais pode incliná-lo ao mal. É dentro desta perspectiva que deve ser
88
compreendida a doutrina da decisão moral na Ética a Nicômacos .

dos por uma escolha (proáiresis). A escolha pertence ao homem que
raciocina e reflete.');

'a a doutrina da decisão moral na Ética a Nicômacos .
Para Aristóteles, os atos, para serem morais, devem ser determina-
dos por uma escolha (proáiresis). A escolha pertence ao homem que
raciocina e reflete. Não pertence à criança ou ao animal. Com efeito,
a escolha sempre implica raciocínio e reflexão e, precisamente, aque-
le tipo de raciocínio e reflexão relativos às coisas e ações que depen-
89
dem de nós e estão na ordem do realizável . O homem age, portan-
to, segundo a razão, de uma maneira deliberada segundo uma medida
e uma regra que o orientam para o fim. Este homem não é levado
pelas paixões, porque o princípio de sua atividade está nele. Ele age,
consciente e voluntariamente, segundo uma regra que sua razão
determina como verdade. Esse tipo de raciocínio e reflexão é chama-
do por Aristóteles deliberação. A diferença entre deliberação e esco-
lha consiste basicamente nisto: a deliberação estabelece quais e
quantas são as ações e os meios necessários para alcançar certos fins:');

'or Aristóteles deliberação. A diferença entre deliberação e esco-
lha consiste basicamente nisto: a deliberação estabelece quais e
quantas são as ações e os meios necessários para alcançar certos fins:
estabelece, assim, toda a série de coisas a realizar para chegar ao
fim, das mais remotas às mais próximas e imediatas; a escolha age
sobre estas últimas e as descarta quando são irrealizáveis, põe-nas
90
em ato quando as encontra realizáveis . Ora, o estabelecimento das
melhores ações e meios é obra da deliberação. A proáiresis é, então,
o momento da decisão, o voto sucedendo a deliberação e que não é
mais somente a manifestação da inteligência deliberante, mas a von-
tade desiderante, aquela que intervém para colocar em oscilação a
deliberação, mas também para colocar fim. A origem da ação é a
escolha e a origem da escolha está no desejo e no raciocínio dirigido
91
a algum fim . Pela proáiresis, o meditado ou projetado torna-se pos-
sível desejo, querido não por ele mesmo, mas como meio');

intenção, isto é, implica disposição ao outro. A atividade moral está no “bem fazer”.
O fim do homem é o bem e consiste essencialmente, não em adquirir qualidades
espirituais, hábitos ou uma certa plenitude para comprazer-se, mas propriamente
ordenar-se ao bem comum, isto é, aos outros cidadãos. Ver a respeito JEAN VANIER,

de um fim . A proáiresis é o desejar deliberativo das coisas que
93
dependem de nós .
Aristóteles introduz uma novidade na relação meio-fim. A escolha,
segundo Aristóteles, não é uma escolha absoluta. A escolha é uma
atividade comparativa e não uma escolha de superioridade ou de
inferioridade. A escolha é sempre a escolha do melhor e esse melhor
designa um superlativo relativo e não absoluto. A escolha, estando
guiada para o melhor, não pode estar dirigida ao impossível. Está
orientada verso às condições da realização do melhor. Tende a ex-
cluir o querer mesmo rumo à inútil mira do impossível. A escolha
torna e restringe a vontade na consideração dos possíveis. A escolha,
mediatizando a vontade (boúlesis), a faz passar do estado da intenção
veladora àquele do querer possível, eficaz e formador do homem
bom. Com efeito, a escolha é a penhora e a apoderação simultânea do
fim e dos meios,');

Neste sentido, Aristóteles contrapõe-se a Platão. Platão insiste sobre
a subordinação do meio ao fim, cuidando para não isolar o meio em
momento independente. A vontade do fim dá sentido ao meio, tor-
nando-o sempre bom. Em Platão, o meio é sempre meio em vista de
um fim. Por isso, a administração dos meios deve ser subordinada à
ciência do fim, isto é, em última análise, do fim supremo que é a
Idéia do Bem. Aristóteles, por sua vez, tem uma compreensão da
relação meios e fins diferente daquela de Platão. No início da Ética a
Nicômacos, Aristóteles também diz que os meios devem levar ao fim.
Sem a ordenação ao fim, o desejo será vazio e inútil. Aristóteles se
preocupa com a adaptação dos meios aos fins; adaptação');

técnicas da ação moral, isto é, a ação não pode desinteressar-se pela realização dos

da contemplação, e, da escolha, mais que da vontade. Ela é uma virtude do risco e

vontade, nem da ação, mas entre os dois, ou seja, na escolha racional, a qual, guiada
pela vontade do bem, decide o melhor possível a cada passo. A moral aristotélica
situa, portanto, o bem e o mal não no absoluto da vontade, mas na escolha dos meios.

de, ao menos para quem age segundo o intelecto e não segundo as
aventuras. Aristóteles, de modo brilhante, coloca, pela primeira vez,
a possibilidade da dissonância entre os meios e o fim e sublinha
também que a qualidade de uma ação se mede não somente pela
retidão da intenção, mas também pela conveniência dos meios. Exis-
tem, portanto, dois domínios onde se produz o bom agir: um reside
no estabelecimento correto do intuito, da intenção do fim das nossas
ações e o outro na descoberta dos meios que conduzem ao fim. À luz
desse raciocínio, podemos dizer: Aristóteles transfere à escolha dos
meios uma parte da responsabilidade moral. O momento propria-
mente ético não se situa então no nível da vontade e nem da ação,
95
mas entre os dois, ou seja, na escolha racional .
Convém ainda recordar aqui que o virtuoso de Aristóteles age sem-
pre sob o imperativo da phrónesis, prudência, que, como virtude do
intelecto prático, inclui o desejo');

Convém ainda recordar aqui que o virtuoso de Aristóteles age sem-
pre sob o imperativo da phrónesis, prudência, que, como virtude do
intelecto prático, inclui o desejo e a virtude: a prudência é o princípio
último da decisão que escolhe os meios para a ação moral. A prudên-
cia é o princípio da escolha racional, a qual, guiada pelo desejo do
bem, decide sempre pelos melhores meios. Cabe, por conseguinte, à
prudência levar-nos a colocar os meios para alcançarmos o fim inten-
cionado pelo desejo que está impregnado de razão. Para agir bem é
necessário, ao mesmo tempo, conhecer o objeto com verdade (virtude
dianoética) e desejá-lo com retidão (virtude moral). A ação será boa
quando as duas coincidirem sobre o mesmo objeto, o que conduzirá
96
necessariamente à decisão e, pela decisão, à ação . Em suma, para
Aristóteles, não basta conhecer o bem, é preciso tornar-se bom, ou
seja, devemos conhecer o bem, o melhor e o mais perfeito, para que

 A “pólis” é a cidade-estado grega. É essencialmente uma comunidade de cidadãos,
isto é, membros plenos de uma cidade. Cidadão significa aqui ter cidadania, isto é,
consiste na participação ativa na administração, na jurisdição e na legislação. O
cidadão é aquele que vive em função de si mesmo e não de outro. A “pólis” e a
sociedade constituída pela liberdade dos cidadãos têm como conteúdo a humanidade
do homem. Na sociedade de cidadãos, orientada pela razão, a natureza do homem se
atualiza. A “pólis” tem sua substância na natureza humana, porque nela a razão se
atualiza. Só na “pólis” é possível conhecer o homem como ser racional, já que através
da comunidade de homens livres a razão pode se atualizar. A natureza racional do
homem só se tornou cognoscível, quando, através da “pólis”, surgiu na história a
sociedade racional. A “pólis”, segundo Aristóteles, é a comunidade perfeita. Ver');

A natureza racional do
homem só se tornou cognoscível, quando, através da “pólis”, surgiu na história a
sociedade racional. A “pólis”, segundo Aristóteles, é a comunidade perfeita. Ver a

 Com efeito, se a felicidade do homem depende das condições sociais e se é somente
na cidade que o homem da ação pode exercer suas virtudes ou que o sábio pode
encontrar seu “lazer e repouso” necessários à contemplação, então, a ética deve
convergir na subordinação à política. Porém, cabe ressaltar este aspecto. Mesmo
diante da subordinação, a ética conserva, por ela mesma, sua especificidade e não se
deixa absorver pura e simplesmente na política. Ela não se confunde neste encontro.
Ela exprime um ponto de vista particular, certamente, incompleto, mas fundamental
no estudo do bem supremo do homem. Ver a respeito JOSEPH MOREAU, La vie sociale
in op. cit., pp. 227-233.

Para concluir, Aristóteles se preocupa com a felicidade concreta

civis ou dos comandos militares que as virtudes éticas encontram
seu campo de ação privilegiado. Aristóteles insiste na união das

'que deve, por sua vez, viver
em Deus contemplando e viver no homem agindo. A felicidade
do homem está na vida contemplativa e na vida ativa. Com ou-
tras palavras, a contemplação é uma vida racional por essência,
visto que é a vida do intelecto, exercendo-se no estado puro. Por
outro lado, a atividade das virtudes éticas, onde a atividade se
inscreve em termos de subordinação e obediência, não é uma vida
racional e, então, uma felicidade senão por participação. Pode-se
dizer, assim, que a ação está para a contemplação como o aciden-
te está para a substância numa relação de hierarquia ontológica.
A felicidade, portanto, está na síntese e simbiose entre a vida
102
contemplativa e ativa .
